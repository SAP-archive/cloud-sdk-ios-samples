# SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS - Sample Apps
This repository hosts a collection of SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS sample apps demonstrating various components and features of the SDK in the context of bigger apps.

Each sample app sits in a separate folder of this repository and is fully self-contained.
They depend on the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS frameworks that can be downloaded from the [SAP Community](https://www.sap.com/developer/trials-downloads/additional-downloads/sap-cloud-platform-sdk-for-ios-14485.html).
Some apps may require further configuration steps that are described in the respective readme files of each app.

# Community
