# AAACardScanApp
This repository hosts an iOS application AAACardScanApp built using SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS.  I use the `SAPFiori` and `SAPML` frameworks to show the OCR scanner capabilities. This is a simple app to scan different objects from a AAA classic card.

## Getting Started

1. Download the [SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS](https://developers.sap.com/topics/cloud-platform-sdk-for-ios.html#details) to get necessary frameworks locally.

2. Clone the repository.

3. Add the `SAPFiori.framework`, `SAPCommon.framework`, `SAPML.framework`, and SAPML-Dependencies `GoogleMobileVision.framework`, `GoogleToolboxForMac.framework`, `GTMSessionFetcherIOS.framework`, and `Protobuf.framework` to the `Embedded Binaries` and `Linked Frameworks and Libraries`.

4. Build and Run ðŸ“¸

5. Walkthrough the code implementation [blogpost](AAACardScanApp.md)

## Disclaimer

<!--  Let's give a more technical description why this would not work for other card formats.  It's because we are doing some pattern matching I believe? -->

This app might not be able to scan all the AAA card formats and would only work with card images provided in the `AAACardScanAppImages` folder. As part of the demo, I have picked a standard AAA card in order to show how to scan objects from a card.
