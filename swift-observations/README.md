# Swift 4 KVO Memory Leak

![App with Allocations Image](ReadMeImages/ObservationMemoryLeak_Project.png)

A project to show a memory leak issue when observing the layer bounds of a view.  

Instead of observing the layer bounds as below:

```
// ‚ùå Causes Crash!
observation = self.observe(\.layer.bounds) { (observed, _) in
    print("üíß Leaking observed!")
}
```

Observing the layer bounds should be observed like:

```
// üëç Safe Observation
observation = self.layer.observe(\.bounds) { (observed, _) in
    print("‚úÖ Safe Observation")
}
```
